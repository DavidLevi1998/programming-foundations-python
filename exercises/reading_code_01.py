Exercise: Reading code carefully

Do NOT run this file immediately.

First, read it line by line and write down
what you think each print statement will output.
"""

x = 3
y = x

x = x + 1

print("x:", x)
print("y:", y)

# --- Part 2 ----------------------------------------------------------

a = 10
b = a

a = a * 2
b = b + 5

print("a:", a)
print("b:", b)

# --- Questions -------------------------------------------------------
#
# 1. At which exact line do a and b stop referring to the same value?
# 2. Did they ever "share" a value, or just have equal values?
# 3. Which assumptions did you make while reading?
#
# Now run the file and compare with your predictions.
#
# If you were wrong, locate the precise moment your mental model broke.
