# How to study this repository

This repository is not meant to be skimmed.

If you are looking for quick recipes or shortcuts, this will feel slow.
That is intentional.

## How to use the code

- Run every file.
- Change values.
- Break things on purpose.
- Observe what actually happens.

Do not assume you understand a file because it looks simple.
Most misunderstandings in programming come from "obvious" code.

## Read actively

When reading a file, pause and ask:
- What does this name refer to *right now*?
- What changed since the previous line?
- What would happen if I reordered these lines?

If you cannot answer, stop and experiment.

## Confusion is expected

If something feels unclear, that is not a failure.
It usually means you are noticing a real conceptual gap.

Do not rush to fix confusion.
Sit with it. Test small variations. Let it resolve.

## Scope of this repository

This repo:
- focuses on fundamentals
- isolates concepts
- avoids real-world apps and frameworks

It is intentionally incomplete.

Understanding comes before usefulness.
